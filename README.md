## <span style="color:#C0BFEC">**📑 Description:**</span>

This practical work included many different interesting topics that were interesting to study:

- Automation of functional testing

- Studying the stages of compilation and the structure of the executable file

- Debugging

- Measurement experiments

However, the largest topic for study was the `measuring experiment`

## <span style="color:#C0BFEC">**🧪 More about the experiment:**</span>

This repository provides two measurement experiments:

- with matrices

- with arrays

Both were implemented using utilities and languages. For example, the entire assembly of measured programs, processing and output is done by `Bash` scripts, and the processing of the received time is done by `Python` scripts.

- To run the experimenter with `arrays`:

```shell
cd src/array_experiment
./go.sh
```

- To run the experimenter with `matrices`:

```shell
cd src/matrix_experiment
./go.sh
```
